    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This training course was adapted form the machine learning accelerator materials. It has been adapted to run outside of Eider.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SageMaker Limit Increase for GPU\n",
    "\n",
    "For the CV1 lab, we will be using GPU SageMaker notebook instances. You will need to request a limit increase +1 for a p2 instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Increase your [SageMaker Limits](https://sagemaker-tools.corp.amazon.com/limits)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Enter your account and preferred region\n",
    "\n",
    "![Account and Region](img/limit_increase_screen1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Select Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "![Select Notebooks](img/limit_increase_screen2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Increase notebook-instance/ml.p2.xlarge limit to 1\n",
    "\n",
    "![Increase Limit](img/limit_increase_screen3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Set justification to \"ML TFC training for computer vision\"\n",
    "\n",
    "![Set Justification](img/limit_increase_screen4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Submit the form. You will receive an automated reply via email, and will immediately be able to spin up a notebook of that instance type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create SageMaker Notebook\n",
    "Now create a SageMaker notebook in the same region. Use the following settings:\n",
    "* Notebook instance name: tfc-training\n",
    "* Notebook instance type: ml.p2.xlarge\n",
    "* Additional configuration -> lifecycle configuration -> on start: Copy [this script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/amazon-sagemaker-notebook-instance-lifecycle-config-samples/master/scripts/auto-stop-idle/on-start.sh) to insure the notebook will shut down automatically after 1 hour of idle time. \n",
    "![Shutdown Script](img/notebook_screen3.png)\n",
    "* IAM role - use default role\n",
    "![IAM Role](img/notebook_screen2.png)\n",
    "* Git repository -> Default repository -> Repository: \"Clone a public git repository\"\n",
    "* Git repository -> Default repository -> Git Repository Url: \"https://github.com/glyfnet/apac-tfc-training.git\"\n",
    "* Hit Create a notebook instance\n",
    "If you see resource limit exceeded error, check you increased limits in same region,a nd that you dont have any other notebooks of that instance type running.\n",
    "* Wait for the notebook to start. \n",
    "* Open with Jupyter. \n",
    "* You should see all the course notebooks pulled from the git repo.\n",

    "### Week 1 - ML Lifecycle, Image Processing, Intro to Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reading \n",
    "Read all the [day 1 lessons](https://mla.corp.amazon.com/computer-vision-i/day-1-computer-vision/). If you need more help on frameworks, these [tutorials](https://mla.corp.amazon.com/computer-vision-i/day-1-computer-vision/libraries-and-frameworks/) will help. **Ignore all links to Eider notebooks** contained in the lessons. Use the corresponding notebooks in this folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Watch Video\n",
    "After reading thru the materials [watch the day 1 lecture](https://drive.corp.amazon.com/documents/MLU%20Lectures/MLA/CV/March%2023-25,%202020/MLA-CV_DAY1_BRENT.mp4). Refer back to reading materials, ask question in chime, and stop and take tutorials for topics you dont understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lab\n",
    "Work through the lab for this week \"day1/Gluon Image Classification Example\". Attempt your first submission using the test data set on your trained model, by adapting \"day1/Submission and Dataset Access\" notebook. **Do not use the submission info on the above pages**. The submission info is below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**leader board not yet implemented. ETA Wednesday**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Office Hours\n",
    "During office hours we will walk through the \"Gluon Image Classification Example\", and then answer any questions."
