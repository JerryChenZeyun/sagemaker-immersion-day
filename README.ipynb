    "> When working though notebooks, take the time to understand what every cell is doing. Read API docs, add your own code modifications, and go through related tutorials for new modules you have not worked with before. It is easy to just \"run\" though the notebook, but you will not learn anything by just clicking \"run\"!\n",

    "* The [Matrix Calculus You Need for Deep Learning](http://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/index.html) - This paper is an attempt to explain all the matrix calculus you need in order to understand the training of deep neural networks. We assume no math knowledge beyond what you learned in calculus 1, and provide links to help you refresh the necessary math where needed. Note that you do not need to understand this material before you start learning to train and use deep learning in practice; rather, this material is for those who are already familiar with the basics of neural networks, and wish to deepen their understanding of the underlying math. Don't worry if you get stuck at some point along the way---just go back and reread the previous section, and try writing down and working through some examples.\n",
